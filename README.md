This repo contains notebooks and projects that I worked on during the NLP Nanodegree offered by Udacity


* In the HMM project, Part of speech tagging is the process of determining the syntactic category of a word from the words in its surrounding context. It is often used to help disambiguate natural language phrases because it can be done quickly with high accuracy. Tagging can be used for many NLP tasks like determining correct pronunciation during speech synthesis and for word sense disambiguation. Here I've use the Pomegranate library to build a hidden Markov model for part of speech tagging using a "universal" tagset. Hidden Markov models have been able to achieve >96% tag accuracy with larger tagsets on realistic text corpora. Hidden Markov models have also been used for speech recognition and speech generation, machine translation, gene recognition for bioinformatics, and human gesture recognition for computer vision, and more.

* the machine translation project I built a deep neural network that function as part of an end-to-end translation machine, accepting English input and generating a French translation output
